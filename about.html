                  Nikki is the driving force behind Nikkster.tech. She has been
                  coding professionally since 2020 and unprofessionally since
                  the Myspace days. Since then, she has built and edited sites
                  for multiple E-commerce brands, small businesses, and
                  organizations.

                  At Nikkster.tech, Nikki takes all the knowledge she's gained
                  from designers, developers, and product managers over the
                  years and brings them directly to you. She combines her
                  passion of helping others and technology by providing clients
                  with modern, sleek websites that not only help her clients
                  reach their goals, but also exceed their expectations.

                  Originally from Southern California, Nikki spent 5 years
                  working in National Parks across the USA. Before that, she
                  worked with local non-profits on active transportation and
                  public land initiatives and taught ecology and water education
                  in the local schools. Currently she resides in Washington
                  State, where she enjoy the easy access to trees and water.

                  When she decided to take the leap and make a career switch,

                My experience as a park ranger and classroom educator gave me
                extensive experience with organizing and leading teams, public
                speaking, and being flexible/problem solving when last minute
                changes arose.
