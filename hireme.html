                  a consultation call. That way I will be able to really dive

                Previously I worked as a park ranger which allowed me to spend
                quality time outdoors and experience life in different parts of
                the United States.

                My experience as a park ranger and classroom educator gave me
                extensive experience with organizing and leading teams, public
                speaking, and being flexible/problem solving when last minute
                changes arose.
