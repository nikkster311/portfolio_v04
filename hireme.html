            <h4>
              Our main goal is to make sure our clients' sites bring in and
              engage customers and that our clients can update their site in the
              future without the need of a developer.

            <h4>
              We pride ourselves in writing code that allows for clients and
              their teams to easily update text and images without the need for
              a developer. Our websites are strategically built to engage your
              specific audience and get them to take action.

                      This designer hired me to add animations to her site and
                      give it a horizontal scroll, to make it stand out from
                      other designer portfolios.

                      <span class="light">WordPress</span> site for him. We
                      worked together to decide what worked best for him and

                  I am passionate about building things that automate the

                Previously I worked as a park ranger which allowed me to spend
                quality time outdoors and experience life in different parts of
                the United States.
              </p>
              <p class="tagline">
                The outdoors inspires my work and drives me to build beautiful,
                thoughtful creations.

              <p>
                My experience as a park ranger and classroom educator gave me
                extensive experience with organizing and leading teams, public
                speaking, and being flexible/problem solving when last minute
                changes arose.
